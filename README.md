# project-2
This is a web scraping project. I have written a script which uses the Wikipedia Open API to search for the famous person and then it pull the content from wikipedia page. The script returns the content in a JSON Format.
I have used Cheerio library for web scraping.

This app is deployed in HEROKU.
